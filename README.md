jconfig
=======

This is a Go package to parse a configuration file using JSON.

It's really simple and does nothing fancy.  We wouldn't have bothered releasing it
except that a few other projects we will be releasing depend on it.

Installation
------------

    go get stathat.com/c/jconfig

    import (
            "stathat.com/c/jconfig"
    )
